                  Hi! Iâ€™m <strong style={{ color: "black" }}>Jainam Sheth</strong> and people usually call me
                  "Jenni". I am a passionate Software Engineer who enjoys creating
                  things that live on the internet: They can be either websites,
                  applications, plugins, APIs, or anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Living on planet Earth since '95, currently I have been busy exploring new places and
                  going to that favourite place again and again.
                  Completed my Engineering from Mumbai University and I began my career as a Software Engineer at Accenture, Mumbai.
                  Lately, I have been busy working on a project called
                  <a href="https://radiant.thoughtspot.com/" title="Documentation of the project" target="_blank" className="radiant"> Radiant </a>
                  which involves developing a design system in React similar to react-bootstrap or material-ui.
                  Apart from that, I strongly believe that a developer should have great exposure to express, story tell, and with
                  technical expertise deliver impactful softwares.
                  My goal here is to build products that create a positive impact on the real world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I am not programming, you can find me discovering a new
                  place, watching a sunset, laying on the couch, star gazing, meditating
                  or dreaming.
